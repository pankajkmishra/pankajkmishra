I am Pankaj K Mishra, an Applied & Computational Geophysicist currently working as a Research Scientist at the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK). With a deep interest in geophysical inverse theory, stochastic methods for parameter optimization, and the integration of scientific machine learning into geoscience, I specialize in 3D Magnetotelluric data acquisition, processing, and inversion. My expertise also extends to the joint inversion of geophysical data using high-performance computing for better subsurface modeling
